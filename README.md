# Online Shop
Java web application based on Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern. It is a completely functional online store with role-based access control. To create the application I used following:

•	Spring (Core, MVC, Security)

•	Hibernate and JPA	

•	MySQL	

•	JSP technology

•	Tomcat 8	

•	Maven tool	

•	JSTL	

•	jQuery plugins (DataTables and Validate)

•	Front-End layer: customized Bootstrap (CSS + JavaScript)	

•	few auxiliary functions in JavaScript language
